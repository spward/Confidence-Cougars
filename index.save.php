					<div class="hero-unit__desc">Confidence Hoops is a basketball program designed to train and promote student athletes by taking them to touraments where they WILL be seen by college coaches.  We are an AAU based program but also participate in ASGR, NTBA, and USS touraments.
</br> We have both boys and girls teams ranging from 8th-11th grade.
 In the off-season our coaches are available to train and help athletes prepare for their school teams.  We offer training from former Division 1 players, who have continued to share their knowledge and skills through coaching.</div>
